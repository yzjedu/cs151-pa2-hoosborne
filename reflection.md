# Reflection Document

_Objective:_

**What were you supposed to learn/accomplish?**
    
Practice Error checking, decision making, looping, and more complicated algorithms. 

_Procedure:_

**What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?**

First, I read the read me file. Then I started working on the algorithm. The read me file gave easy, step by step, instructions on how to develop an algorithm for this complex issue.
After that, I revised my final design, I found a few issues in my initial design. Then, I completed, tested, and revised the code. Lastly, I created the flowchart.

**_What were the Key concepts explored?_**

Error checking, looping, decision making, flowcharts, complex algorithms. 

_Results:_

**Did your results match what you expected to get?**

There were a couple hiccups with the code, mainly phrasing issues with while statements. However, after fixing those, the results matched the expected ones.

**Did you try using various test cases, or extreme test cases?**

Yes. The code error checks the user inputs and re-prompts the user to enter a valid input. 

_Reflection:_

**What challenges did you encounter?**

When going over my initial design, I found an issue in the way I phrased the "turn" variable and fixed that in my final design.
I also couldn't complete the flowchart in python because the software was extremely laggy. 

**How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?**

1. Think before Programming: I read the read me file and completed the algorithm before starting to program.
2. Program is the embodiment of the algorithm: My code follows the algorithm
3. Improve through practice: By completing this PA, I improved my algorithm, flowchart, and programming skills. 

**Did you overcome them, and how?**

I completed the flowchart on the draw.io website and uploaded a picture in pycharm instead, and I fixed the issues in my final design.

**Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab?**

Yes I do.

**What was it like working by yourself?**

I liked it. It was different because I didn't have someone to bounce ideas off of, but I still feel like I understood the problem well.
